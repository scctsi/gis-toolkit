# GIS Toolkit

## Purpose
The GIS toolkit enables institutions to enhance physical addresses with a set of curated Social and Environmental Determinants of Health [SEDoH](https://health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/social-determinants-health) variables. These variables belong to several domains, including:
* Social and community contexts
* Economic contexts
* Education
* Physical infrastructure
* Environmental conditions

The GIS toolkit also guides institutions on how they can integrate these variables with data warehouses and cohort discovery tools like [Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside (i2b2)](https://www.i2b2.org/), enabling researchers at those institutions to search for cohorts using criteria based on SEDoH variables.

## Components
The GIS toolkit has three main components:
1. Python program
2. Guides
   * Integrating with the [Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM)](https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/the-common-data-model/)
   * Integrating with the i2b2 CDM
3. Excel utility to help extend an i2b2 ontology
